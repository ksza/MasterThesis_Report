Describe the big picture in words and using a picture as well! Describe the main components imposed by this architecture: 3D modelling (to represent the space), rendering and movement control to build the simulated environment, categorization algorithms AND programming API (including the ContextClient).\\

In the remaining of this chapter good deep into details about why I've chose certain technologies for each component; put each discussion in its own section! To better argue, present several technologies that could fit the same requirements and argue objectively about the the reasons I've made certain choices. I should refer back to arguments in the related work!
