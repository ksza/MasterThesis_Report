\section{Services inside the Smart Home: A Simulation and Visualization tool}\label{sec:services_in_smart_homes}

In this work \cite{lazovik2009services} the aim is to reduce the testing costs of smart homes. The goal was achieved by implementing a simulation and visualization tool which replaces services in a smart home with virtual stubs behaving just like the real hardware installed in a house.\\

The simulation scenarios are built using Google SketchUp \cite{sketchup:online}. This was extended with a set of tools extending its visual representation of a house with virtual home interactive web services supporting SOAP messages. Further, the visualization component is written as a set of plug-ins for Google SketchUp.\\

The simulation and visualization tool allows to simulate any possible home automation scenario, with the possibility of modeling the user and its interactions with the home.
