Researchers studying Ubicomp environments have typically been facing one common problem: evaluating the system. This is because to set up the target environment requires space, money and a lot of time; and even if they have access to the whole infrastructure, sometimes is almost impossible to experiment on real case scenarios because of the technological limitations on gathering the contextual data required by the targeted system. Even if all these challenges are overcome, real and large scale experiments are really expensive, hence only a limited number can be conducted.\\

To address these issues, a number of projects have tried to develop simulation tools and frameworks in various research areas, some of them being generic, others being more targeted towards a certain domain.\\

In this chapter we will present the work in this area, we found most relevant and inspiring for this work.
