In this chapter we will walk the system designer through the steps required to set up a simulation from scratch. It also covers how to interact with the environment from the simulation user's point of view. The user guide is written by example, using a concrete environment model -- the childrpoof.blend model which was used in the evaluation). To set up a simulation based on a different model, simply use the other model and take particular configuration actions as required by your use case.
