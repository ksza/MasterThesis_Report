%************************************************
We have recruited a total of 17 participants, out of which 12 male and 5 female. All of them experienced Software Engineers, 15 working in the industry, 1 Post-Doctoral Researcher and 1 Associate Professor. Their average experience in software engineering is 6.41 years, with an average of 1.56 year of experience in mobile development. 47.1\% are familiar with concepts of context-aware computing, while only 29.4\% have actually worked on context-aware systems. Finally, one participant was familiar with concepts of the egocentric interaction paradigm or the SSM.\\

To evaluate to what extent we have met the goals defined in Section \ref{sec:goal}, we conducted an evaluation in two parts. The whole evaluation session, including reading the documentation and providing feedback, lasted between 90 and 120 minutes.\\

First we have evaluated a simulation created with the EgoSim framework from the simulation user's perspective. The users were able to explore a ready made simulation while observing contextual changes in the context client. Second, we have evaluated the EgoSim framework from the system designer's perspective, as the users built a simulation using our framework. Moreover, to determine how our system is different from existing system, we have compared EgoSim to two of the most relevant systems in the related work.\\
