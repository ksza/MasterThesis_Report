The results presented in this chapter, conclude that we have managed to develop a usable open-source simulation tool for applications designed based on the egocentric interaction paradigm. We have managed to satisfy the objectives laid out in Section \ref{sec:goal}. By fulfilling the current work we have successfully implemented a first version the EgoSim framework, with many possibilities for future work as detailed in Section \ref{sec:eval_future_work}. The feedback from our evaluation participants have strengthen the assumption that there is a real need for this tool, as they have provided concrete examples of real-life problems solve using the SSM context model. Finally, the comparison between UbiWise, TATUS and EgoSim confirms that this framework contributes with another dimension to the worlds of 3D ubiquitous computing simulators.
