Designing and developing context-aware mobile systems, in real-life set-ups, based on the Egocentric Interaction Paradigm \cite{pederson2010towards}, represents a tedious, costly and time consuming process. These facts impose a challenge for researchers to efficiently work with the Egocentric Interaction Paradigm. To overcome these challenges, I am designing and developing a simulation environment for mobile context-aware system design, focusing on the egocentric paradigm. The framework will monitor the agent's context in regards to the world space and the context of physical and virtual objects.\\
