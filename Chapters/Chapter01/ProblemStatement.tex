Designing and developing mobile context-aware systems in a real-life set-up represents a tedious, costly and time consuming process. In addition, most systems require testing and experimentation in their target location for valid and beneficial results to be produced; however it is difficult and costly to set up a certain location to support the designed system. Moreover, incorporating physical objects into the system design, adds up to the aforementioned challenges.

% These facts impose a challenge for researchers to efficiently work with the Egocentric Interaction Paradigm. 

% To overcome these challenges, I am designing and developing a simulation environment for mobile context-aware system design, focusing on the egocentric paradigm. The framework will monitor the agent's context in regards to the world space and the context of surrounding entities.\\
