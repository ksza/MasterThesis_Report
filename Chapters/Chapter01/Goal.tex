The goal of this project is to design and implement an open-source simulation environment for mobile context-aware system design. The framework will monitor the context of physical objects, virtual objects and mediators \cite{pederson2011situative} in regards to the agent's parameters (i.e. location, field of vision, body position sitting / standing, objects within the agent's reach etc.). The agent represents an avatar of the user interacting with the simulated environment.\\

The followings represent the goal of my thesis project:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The framework should be able to adequately represent aspects of the SSM and update the model in real time, based on the input of an event generator (i.e. the simulator).
	\item Implement a simulator to generate events which trigger contextual changes in the framework.
	\item Visualize, in real time, the SSM spaces, as contextual changes occur.
	\item Host all the work in a publicly available source control repository.
\end{enumerate}

The objects simulated by the framework will have the following characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
	\item they can be physical objects, virtual object (i.e. software) and mediators (i.e. devices, sensors)
	\item they can be composed; for example a lamp can be placed on a table, an electronic calendar can be placed on the wall
	\item more specialized devices can be represented, like wearable devices, hand-held devices (i.e. mobile phones, tablets)
	\item their state is made up by attributes like: position (within the simulated environment), height, weight, relations with other objects (i.e. pen placed on top of a paper), and various other specific state attributes (e.g. on/off for a lamp)
	\item some of the objects might receive data from external, real-life objects; for example, a simulated sensor motion sensor could have its data retrieved from a motion sensor installed in the same room with the researchers
\end{itemize}

For the agent, the framework will monitor a set of characteristics and allow a certain set of actions to be carried out. The following statements present details:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the framework will monitor location within the simulated environment, visual spectrum (the objects within it), distance to each perceived object, body position (sitting/standing)
	\item the agent's movement can be easily controlled in an intuitive user interface
	\item the agent can pick up objects if possible (based on weight, proximity etc.), carry objects around, put objects down
	\item objects can be in the agent's hand, pocket, backpack etc.
	\item the agent can interact with digital devices (e.g. gestures on a touch scree, press buttons)
\end{itemize}

At this time, it is very uncertain if I will be able to fulfill all the above goals and it is left up to the Design Chapter \ref{ch:design} to decide how we approach the goals of this research.
