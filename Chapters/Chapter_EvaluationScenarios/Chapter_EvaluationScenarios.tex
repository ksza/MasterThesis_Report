\chapter{Evaluation Scenarios}\label{ch:evaluation_scenarios}
%************************************************
In this chapter we detail the scenarios we have imagined for our test subjects to guide them in evaluating the EgoSim framework. The first scenario has the purpose of making the user familiar with the framework. The second scenario was imagined for the simulation user role, where the subject is evaluating a simulation built using our framework. In the third scenario we have imagined a problem which a system designer can solve using the EgoSim framework.\\

We have built the first two prototypes into executable binaries for three major operating systems: Mac OS X, Windows and Linux. The builds are included with the thesis in the \emph{EvaluationPrototypes.zip} archive. They are also available at \url{http://karolyszanto.ro/MastersThesis/evaluation/prototypes/}.\\

Videos of running the three scenarios are available; see Appendix \ref{ch:videos}.\\
