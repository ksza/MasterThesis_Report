In this chapter we detail the scenarios we have imagined for our test subjects to guide them in evaluating the EgoSim framework. The first scenario has the purpose of making the user familiar with the framework. The second scenario was imagined for the simulation user role, where the subject is evaluating a simulation built using our framework. In the third scenario we have imagined a problem which a system designer can solve using the EgoSim framework.
