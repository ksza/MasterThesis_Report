THIS IS FROM UBIWISE. I CAN PROVIDE THIS INFO, OF HOW TO USE THE FINAL PRODUCT IN AN APPENDIX!

"The core of the simulation is creating the virtual counterparts of devices and the
picture frames present in the physical environment. The next section charts the path
taken to create these virtual objects, focusing on the camera as our example. It also
introduces and develops the two views and their roles separately. We try to give a
sense of the time a researcher will need for the various steps. We wrap up the
discussion with a description of the simulator at runtime and we describe how the two
views come together to form a complete whole."
