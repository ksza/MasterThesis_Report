This chapter describes the choices made during the implementation of the design defined in Chapter \ref{ch:design}. Our system's architecture was tailored to fit within the architecture of a game engine, each individual component being tied to certain concepts from the game engines terminology.\\ 

In Section \ref{sec:simulation_runtime} we have argued for the benefits of using a game engine as the building block for the EgoSim framework. There are many available game engines which could fit our design, just to mention a few:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Source\footnote{\url{https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source}}, Half Life's game engine, was used to build the TATUS \ref{sec:tatus} ubiquitous computing simulator
	\item Quake III Arena's game engine from ID Software\footnote{\url{http://www.idsoftware.com/gate.php}}, was used to build the UbiWise \ref{sec:ubiwise} device-centric simulator
	\item jMonkey Engine version 2.0 \cite{jme:online}, was used to build the simulation in the SIMACT \ref{sec:simact} smart home infrastructure simulator
	\item Unity\footnote{\url{http://unity3d.com/}} is a new cross-platform game engine, having a large number of game developers adopting it as a platform of choice when developing a game.
\end{itemize}

Previous to starting this project we had no knowledge of game development and game engines whatsoever. We have ran across Source, Quake III Arena and jMonkey Engine (JME) during research of related work, while we have heard of Unity due to all the buzz that formed around it lately. Source, Quake III Arena and Unity require strong knowledge of game development and of the game engine at hand in order to become proactive. JME on the other hand has been implemented as a ''3D game engine for adventurous Java developers''. Moreover, ''it's open source, cross platform and cutting edge. And it is all beautifully documented'' \cite{jme:online}. One can become proactive in JME while learning it.\\

We have decided to use jMonkey Engine in the EgoSim's framework implementation. It is tailored for experience Java developers in need to perform complex 3D interactive simulation tasks. It has a well written documentation and has formed a big and helpful community around it, which is really important to help developers get up to speed with game development. The community helped us to find answers to various problems we have encountered. Finally, it is open source, helping us achieve this aspect for our system as well, as described in goal \ref{goal:4}.\\

SIMACT \ref{sec:simact} has used an old version of the jMonkey Engine (v 2.0). This version has stopped being developed and supported in 2008. In 2009 the community started up with new ideas, rewriting the framework from scratch, resulting on the current jMonkey Engine version 3.0.\\

JME is a community-centric open source project, especially built for modern 3D development. It is written purely in the Java programming language and it uses the Lightweight Java Game Library (LWJGL)\footnote{\url{http://lwjgl.org}} as its default renderer. JME by itself is a collection of libraries, but to provide an integrated development environment, the community made available the JME SDK/platform. The SDK is based on the NetBeans Platform\footnote{\url{https://netbeans.org/features/platform}}, providing all the necessary tools needed to develop a game in JME. It is designed to be easily used by Java developers to build games/simulation without previous game development knowledge. The learning curve is easy, compared to other game engines, teaching the developer both to build games and to learn the concepts and terminology of game development.\\

However, the design we came up with in Chapter \ref{ch:design} is universally applicable within most available modern 3D game engines. Implementing this design using various game engines should not pose a challenge, as long as the developers are familiar with the game engine of their choice.\\

Figure \ref{fig:egosim_structure} illustrates the project's structure within the JME SDK. ''EgoSim'' represents a Java project with JME dependencies and capabilities. The items highlighted in screenshot are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The Project Assets holds resources to be used in the simulation. For example, the Scenes folder contains the environment models, the Sounds folder contains the sounds which can be played in a simulation, etc.
	\item The Source Package folder contains the source code of the EgoSim framework.
	\item The Libraries folder contains the Java ARchive (JAR) dependencies of the EgoSim project. These are both JME library dependencies as well as other third party libraries we have used throughout the development process.
	\item The Run button. Runs the current simulation.
\end{enumerate}

To get up to speed with jMonkey Engine development, you can access the following resource:
\begin{itemize}
	\item read the official documentation web page \url{http://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/wiki/doku.php/documentation} to get up to speed with JME concepts
	\item ask questions or search answer on the JME community forum \url{http://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/forum}
	\item consult the JME JavaDoc \url{http://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/javadoc}
	\item read the JME Beginner's Guide book \cite{kusterer2013jmonkeyengine}
\end{itemize}

In this section we will go through the implementation of each component presented in the design Chapter \ref{ch:design}, in the exact same order. We will first describe the Simulation Designer \ref{sec:impl_simulation_designer} and how it can be used to work with the 3D models JME is compatible with and how to configure the objects with Ego Metadata. Next, we will present the Simulation Runtime \ref{sec:impl_simulation_runtime} and how it helps us in bringing those 3D models to ''life''. We continue with the rest of the components : The Agent \ref{sec:impl_the_agent}, Monitoring Service \ref{sec:impl_monitoring_service}, The API \ref{sec:impl_api} and finally the Context Client \ref{sec:impl_context_client}.\\

The source code of the framework is available; see Appendix \ref{ch:source_code}. Using the framework to set up a new simulation is described in details in Appendix \ref{ch:user_guide}.\\

% "The core of the simulation is creating the virtual counterparts of devices and the
% picture frames present in the physical environment. The next section charts the path
% taken to create these virtual objects, focusing on the camera as our example. It also
% introduces and develops the two views and their roles separately. We try to give a
% sense of the time a researcher will need for the various steps. We wrap up the
% discussion with a description of the simulator at runtime and we describe how the two
% views come together to form a complete whole."


% Objects within the view frustum are not always on the direction of the camera, so based on the two positional vector, we need to determine the directional vector (the direction of the ray). The directional vector between two positional vectors is given by their difference. Therefore, to find the directional vector from the agent to the centre of the target object, we can subtract the agent's positional vector from the object's positional vector.
