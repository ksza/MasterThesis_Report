%************************************************
In this section we will present the implementation of the Simulation Runtime component. This component is responsible for loading up the 3D model of the target environment and perform all necessary initializations (including the World Space). It also represents the entry point of the simulation.\\

% We have provided a generic solution which helps system designers easily create a new simulation.
