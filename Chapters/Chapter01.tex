%I am structuring the introduction according to this guide: http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~saul/wiki/pmwiki.php/Chapter1/Deconstruction. It's Saul Greenbarg's guide to thesis chapter 1's, but I think it works fine for smaller projects as well. If we find %that the structure doesn't work we can always change it, but for now I think its a good way to do it (as it forces me think about every aspect)
